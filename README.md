> This repository contains a reference for global styles & icons used in JW Player products. Usage guidelines and code snippets for the following can be found on the [JW Design Site](https://design.jwplayer.com/docs/#/).

## Use Hook in Your Project
### Styles
Hook styles can be included in two ways:

#### Option 1: Pull Less Into Build
Import Hook in it's entirety, for example:
```less
@import 'jw-design-library/styles/hook';
@import './less/your_other_styles';
```

Or simply reference only the files you need:
```less
@import 'jw-design-library/styles/variables/fonts';
@import 'jw-design-library/styles/mixins/global';
```

#### Option 2: CDN-Hosted, Minified CSS
You can also include minified CSS in the document `<head>`. Please keep in mind that this option is **plain CSS**, which will **only output** the selectors and styles for items in the `components` folder (like icons & logos). This does not come with variables and mixins.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://hook.jwplayer.com/core/hook.min.css">
```
View our full list of hosted styles at [hook.jwplayer.com](http://hook.jwplayer.com/).

### Typography
To use Hook fonts, simply invoke the import mixin by calling `.ds-font-imports()` in your Less.  **(We recommend doing this only once in your main stylesheet to avoid extraneous requests.)**  View usage guidelines [here](https://design.jwplayer.com/docs/#/patterns/typography).

### Iconography
The icons folder contains two SVG sprites, `icons-player` and `icons-dashboard`, that can be easily referenced and customized with CSS.  View usage guidelines [here](https://design.jwplayer.com/docs/#/patterns/iconography).

### Running Locally
To run this project on your machine & watch/compile any changes:
```
npm install
grunt
```

### Adding a New Stylesheet
1. Add your LESS stylesheet to the `styles` folder
2. Import it in the `hook.less` master file with the appropriate path

### Adding a New Icon
1. Determine if your new icon belongs to the player or dashboard and add the SVG to the appropriate folder
2. Grunt will auto-generate a new sprite with all icons
