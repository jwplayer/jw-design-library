> Hook is the single source of truth for global colors, icons & styles used in JW Player products. Built with 
[Amazon Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/).

## Install

Via the [JW Player NPM registry](https://npm-registry.longtailvideo.com/-/web/detail/@design/jw-design-library) **(recommended)**:
```bash
yarn add @design/jw-design-library
```

... or from a specific GitHub tagged version:
```bash
yarn add @design/jw-design-library@github:jwplayer/jw-design-library#<version>
```

## Getting Started
To use Hook's variables, simply import them from the CSS/Less/SCSS directories in `/dist`.

### Colors
Import the color variables and apply them in your stylesheet like this:

```scss
@import (reference) "@design/jw-design-library/dist/scss/brand-colors.scss";
@import (reference) "@design/jw-design-library/dist/scss/data-colors.scss";
@import (reference) "@design/jw-design-library/dist/scss/system-colors.scss";

.my-cool-icon {
    fill: $ds-color-brand-dahlia;
}

.system-status-success {
    color: $ds-color-system-green;
}

.mango-gradient {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, $ds-color-ramp-data-scale-mango-7);
}
```

### JavaScript Variables
You can also import colors in JS (`dist/js/`) for use with a libraries like [tinycolor](https://github.com/typectrl/tinycolor) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

#### Example
```js
import { TinyColor } from '@ctrl/tinycolor';
import { dsColorSystemRed } from 'jw-design-library/dist/js/system-colors.js';

const color = new TinyColor(dsColorSystemRed);
```

### Fonts
We recommend referencing the CDN route in your HTML (so you're not duplicating the font files into your project).

```html
<link href="https://hook.jwplayer.com/jw-design-library/<version>/css/fonts.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Then apply the `font-family` variables:

```scss
body {
    font-family: $ds-global-font-family-brand;
}

.code-snippet {
    font-family: $ds-global-font-family-code;
}
```

**Note:** if you choose to use `dist/css/fonts.css` instead, then you must copy or resolve the paths for the font files (`dist/fonts/`), or things won't work!

### Icons
Icons can be imported directly from Hook, but we **ðŸš¨  strongly recommend using [WUI components](https://stg-wui.jwplayer.com/component/icon) for this approach!ðŸš¨** 
```js
import download from '@design/jw-design-library/dist/icon/dashboard/download.svg';
```

#### SVG Sprites
If you'd rather reference icons from a simple SVG sprite, include your spritesheet somewhere in the body of your HTML and reference the `symbol` you need by ID (`{ds-icon-{dashboard/player/logo}-{icon_name}`).

```html
<!-- The sprite -->
<svg>
    <use xmlns:xlink="https://hook.jwplayer.com/jw-design-library/5.3.0/sprites/sprites-dashboard.svg"></use>
</svg>

<!-- Your SVG -->
<svg class="my-cool-icon"><use href="#ds-icon-dashboard-play" /></svg>
```


## Contribute to Hook

### Install & Build
To build this project locally, ensure you're using **Node v10** and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

To build the `/dist` folder with your new updates:

```bash
yarn build
```
To remove the `/dist` folder completely:

```bash
yarn clean
```

### Updating Hook
1. Create a feature branch from `master`
2. Pull in any new SVG files into the `dictionary/assets` folder
3. In `/dictionary/properties`, locate the `yaml` config of choice and add new names/values in accordance with file structure
4. Run `yarn build`. If the build succeeds, you should see your changes in the `/dist` folder.
5. Bump the version # accordingly to align with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
6. Open a PR against `master`. You **must** note ðŸ’¥ breaking changes ðŸ’¥ in your PR so projects that depend on Hook are updated appropriately


### Publish to NPM
Hook (@design/jw-design-library) is published on [JW Player's internal npm registry](https://npm-registry.longtailvideo.com/#/). 

1. Set your local npm config to the internal registry ([npmrc](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/npmrc) is recommended for setting multiple configs)
```
npm set registry https://npm-registry.longtailvideo.com
```
2. Checkout `master` and pull in the latest
```
git checkout master && git pull
```
3. Double check that your local `master` branch contains everything you need in the `dist` folder
4. Double check that your new version number is correct
5. If all is well, publish it:
```
npm publish
```
6. Your updated package should appear [here](https://npm-registry.longtailvideo.com/-/web/detail/@design/jw-design-library) when complete
7. Draft a release with any updates and ðŸ’¥ breaking changesðŸ’¥ in this repo.


### How Hook Works (Under the Hood)
The file `build.js` imports various modules from `scripts/` to build the full style-dictionary config. Here's a really quick rundown:

* `formatters/svg-sprite` runs each matched icon through SVGO, then converts the
  SVG into a `<symbol>`. After all icons in the group are optimized, a wrapper is
  added and the SVG file is output.
* `formatters/font-face` uses the structure found in `font-face.yaml` to
output `@font-face` declarations in CSS. All font files referenced in the
dictionary are copied to `dist/fonts`. If you use `fonts.css` then you must copy
or resolve the paths for the font files, or things won't work!
* `transformers/content-array-to-list`: Converts property values into
  comma-separated lists. This is used to output data colors for Less.
  ```yaml
  prop:
    value:
    - '#000000'
    - '#CCCCCC'
    - '#FFFFFF'
  ```
  The example above has this final output:
  ```less
  @prop: #000000, #cccccc, #ffffff;
  ```
* `transformers/content-list-to-js-array`: Converts property values into
  bracketed arrays. This, combined with `content-array-to-list`, is used to
  output data colors for JS. The example above has this final output:
  ```js
  export const prop = ["#000000","#cccccc","#ffffff"];
  ```
* `transform-groups/less-transform-group`: Overrides the built-in `less`
  transformGroup, to add `content/arrayList` and switch to `color/css` for rgba
  output.
* `transform-groups/js-transform-group`: Overrides the built-in `js`
  transformGroup, to add `content/arrayToList` and `content/listToJsArray`.
* `utils/mock-require`: Rather than rewrite the `combineJSON` function present
  in `style-dictionary`, we intercept the `require` call itself to render YAML
  with `js-yaml` when necessary. This may change if `combineJSON` ever changes.
* `utils/svgo`: Since SVGO is asynchronous by design, we use a wrapper module
  with [sync-rpc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-rpc) to treat it as if it's
  synchronous. You may notice the dots when `icons` are being built - each dot
  represents a sprite that has been "synchronously" optimized by SVGO.
